*tscalc* is a simple calculator website inspired on Apple, and my first website to be based on Typescript(TS.)

This calc is pretty decent and can do simple math calculations, except its free to use, easy to use and has very nice design.

## Later update suggestions:

- Turn it into an app(Not planned yet)📱🖥️.
- Add theme switch(The latest feature gonna be released)🌇🌆. ✅
- Learn more like this(I like typescript)⌨️🖱️
- Improve the design...😄
- Bug fixes, updates and even more. ✅
